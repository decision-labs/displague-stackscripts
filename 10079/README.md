# Rootless and GitHub User has sudo

Sick of passwords?  Have a GitHub account configured with your favorite ssh keys?

You've come to the right place.  This StackScript removes the barrier to entry.  The root password has been disabled, so you can't ssh in as root.  But wait, root is not out of reach!  

With one simple text entry of your GitHub username, all of your GitHub configured ssh keys will be authorized for login with your existing GitHub username.  Root password? Who needs it.  While you will be prompted for one, this miracle script will promptly remove the root password on first boot.

Your GitHub username is all you need to sudo or su.  No more secrets!

( But wait! Password-less root tty logins are currently available. This is a limited time offer, only valid in LISH )
